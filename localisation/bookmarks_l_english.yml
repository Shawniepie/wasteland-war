 OWB_NAME:0 "Old World Blues"
 OWB_DESC:0 "Atomic fire scorched the earth in the year 2077 and humanity has yet to fully recover. Desperate struggles erupt across north america as the sane fight for their lives against hordes of insane and depraved raiders. Monolithic giants such as the New California Republic and Caesars Legion seek to expand their grasp, whilst the technocratic and secretive Brotherhood of Steel scour the ruins others forget. Despite all the chaos, one thing remains certain; war, war never changes."
 NCR_OWB_DESC:0 "The NCR, the first nation of it's kind in the wasteland, is a federation of six states with President Tandi at it's head. With a growing unknown power to it's north, religious nuts to their north, and raiders all around them, the NCR is faced with problems. Will Tandi be able to keep the NCR in one nation, or will it divded just as the Old World was?"
 BOS_OWB_DESC:0 "Their resounding victory over the Enclave at Navarro gave the Brotherhood much to celebrate, but the following years were punishing. Jeremy Maxson died suddenly, and his successor Jonathan Maxson was killed in action. The next Maxson had been sent east to D.C., and so the Elders were forced to choose one of their own. Mari Törni, a Navarro veteran, was chosen to lead.\n\nBrotherhood operations remain the same: discover tech, steal tech, kill those who disagree. They're expanding their sphere of influence to include the Shi, the Mojave Chapter, and Arroyo. The NCR watches with caution."
 OTHER_OWB_DESC:0 "The Great War plunged the world into seemingly eternal darkness and threw everything into chaos. People struggled to survive and over the decades the survivors banded into larger and larger groups.\n\nSettlers continue on in an attempt to retain the morals of the old world. Tribals stalk the lands of their ancestors, hunting and avoiding the technology left behind by the old world. Raiders continue to dominate the wasteland, killing, pillaging, and burning. Resources are scarce and the numerous communities of the wasteland are always struggling to survive."
